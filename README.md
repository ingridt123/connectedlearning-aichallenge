# CIS Connected Learning AI Challenge

### Task
Write a computer program that takes a "third-grade real-world math problem" as input, and produces the correct solution as output. See example below:
**Input:** If Rachel ate 276 grams of bacon and 147 grams of sausages, how much food did she eat in total?  
**Output:** 423 grams

### Methodology (draft)
- Possibility array checks for probability of each operator based on a number of parameters (e.g. key words), which is used at the end of the program to determine operator
- Units are determined as the word after "how much" or "how many"
